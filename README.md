# react_marvel_app
Testing out React based on their examples and documentation. Tossed the Marvel API into the mix as well :) Some of this is totally junk code for testing.

##Getting things setup

Clone this project
Get a Marvel API Key
Add Localtest.me or some other version of localhost to valid Marvel referrers (Under "My Developer Account" on the developer.marvel.com website.)
Create /scripts/key.js and add something like window.key = "yourkeyhere";
Run the site on some type of local webserver. I generally use http-server (npm install -g http-server);
